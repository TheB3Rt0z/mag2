## HomePage Module ENG

With the iways Homepage Module you are able to create appealing frontpages for your Magento Shop.

### The Tile Settings
First you need to select a Layout. You can choose from 4 different ones which are shown in
pictures below the dropdown menu. Layout 1 to 3 only use 4 tiles, so you don't need to edit
tile 5 and 6 if you are using them.

Every tile has a lot of customization options to make them look unique:

1. You can upload a picture to set as the background of the tile. Every tile has 
a recommended image-size per layout. To show the full image, it should have that size
or the same aspect ratio. Dimensions: width x height, measured in pixels
    
    - Tile 1: This tile always has the size of 1240 x 450
    - Tile 2: 1. 390 x 338 | 2. 403 x 543 | 3. 405 x 645 | 4. 407 x 616
    - Tile 3: 1. 390 x 338 | 2. 830 x 266 | 3. 405 x 645 | 4. 815 x 261
    - Tile 4: 1. 390 x 338 | 2. 830 x 266 | 3. 405 x 645 | 4. 815 x 261
    - Tile 5: 4. 391 x 338
    - Tile 6: 4. 407 x 618
    
2. Underneath are the controls for the Title which will be displayed on a white box 
over the image. Here you can set the content, the color and the font family. To choose a color
simply click on the input field to makes a color picker appear. To be able to choose the font 
family, you first need to set a google api-key under Stores->Configuration->i-Ways->Google Fonts.

3. In the next section you can edit the text that is displayed below the title. The inputs are
the same as with the title, but you have the additional field "Text position". This determines 
where the box will appear on the image. There are 6 different settings: no text, top left, 
top right, bottom left, bottom right and center.

4. Lastly there are the controls for the link that can be associated with the tile.
The "Link" field expects an URL: e.g. https://www.i-ways.net/ or subpages from your Magento
Webpage: e.g. woman/tops-woman.html.<br>
The "Use Button as Link" field lets you decide if you want to have the link on the full tile,
so that the user can click on it when hovering over it, or if you want a smaller button
underneath the image text inside the textbox. In the "Button Text" field you can set the text,
that the button will display. If none is set, it will display "See more".

### The Hot Sellers
The Hot Sellers will appear below the tiles on the homepage if they are activated. If they are,
all 4 Product IDs must be set. Clicking on "Select Item" opens a new Window where you can
select a product from a table of all products. After selecting a product its id will show 
in the associated input field.
